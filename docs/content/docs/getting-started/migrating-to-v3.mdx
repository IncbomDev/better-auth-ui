This guide walks you through upgrading from v2 to v3.

## What changed

- AuthCard removed → use AuthView
- SettingsCards removed → use AccountView
- OrganizationView (presentational) was renamed to OrganizationCellView
- Provider changes:
  - settings → account
  - Split paths: authViewPaths, accountViewPaths, organizationViewPaths

## Provider before

```tsx
<AuthUIProvider
  basePath="/auth"
  settings={{ basePath: "/dashboard", fields: ["image", "name"] }}
  viewPaths={{ SIGN_IN: "login" }}
/>
```

## Provider after

```tsx
<AuthUIProvider
  basePath="/auth"
  account={{ basePath: "/dashboard", fields: ["image", "name"] }}
  authViewPaths={{ SIGN_IN: "login" }}
  organization={{ basePath: "/organization", slugPaths: false }}
/>
```

## Routing examples

- Auth (signed-out):

```tsx
<AuthView pathname={pathname} />
```

- Account:

```tsx
<AccountView pathname={pathname} />
```

- Organization:

```tsx
<OrganizationView pathname={pathname} />
```

## Type and API changes

- Replace AuthCardClassNames with AuthViewClassNames
- viewPaths is now auth-only; use accountViewPaths/organizationViewPaths for others

## Accept invitation

- Moved under account flow; use accountViewPaths.ACCEPT_INVITATION in your routes and render <AccountView />

## Checklist

- [ ] Remove AuthCard imports
- [ ] Replace SettingsCards with AccountView
- [ ] Rename OrganizationView (presentational) usages to OrganizationCellView
- [ ] Provider: settings → account
- [ ] Update links to use split view paths
